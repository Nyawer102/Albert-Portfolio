            <p>When I was a child, Seaman is my first dream. To travel around the whole world and to work with other races is my goal. But as time goes by I already knew we cannot afford my dream to become a Seaman. I was sad but need to accept the reality too. One day my parents bought me a computer. It is really slow and laggy. I don't know where it came from but I am attached to my computer so bad. I am very curious how it works, how it functions, how to install and download something. That is the first step why I love editing now.</p>
